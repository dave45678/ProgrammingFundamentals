# What is object-oriented programming?

Programming is an attempt to create a representation of reality on the computer. There's a lot of tools and devices that exist that do this already -- think about how a spreadsheet makes it easier for us to represent accounting or statistics, or how a Powerpoint presentation allows us to store and display our presentations.

Sometimes we need to build custom representations of reality into new or existing applications that reflect our business processes. There's lots of ways to program, and one of the most common ways to program is object oriented programming, where the code we build is specifically designed to replicate the concepts of reality. The "things" in reality have attributes and behaviors. For instance, a human being often has arms and legs, hair color, ethnicity, and can often Speak and Walk.

Speaking and Walking can come in different varieties, such as what language one is speaking, or the speed or manner at which one is walking.

Human Beings often have interactions with other types of "things," whether they be animals, other humans, other living organisms, or inanimate objects. There are themes in reality that often need a way to be represented, such as interactions between "things," categorization of things, etc. Consider business processes that go on in our organization. There exists very complicated "business logic" that needs to get represented in the software that our organization uses.

Object Oriented programming provides a means to accurately represent these "real world concepts" and "business logic".

####Summary
Programmers model objects; and:
* objects have state (fields/data members)
* objects have actions (methods/functions)
* objects build upon each other (inheritance)
