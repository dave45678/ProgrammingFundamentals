difference betw 2.7 and 3.5
Python 2.7 is the last major release in the 2.x series, as the Python maintainers have shifted the focus of their new feature development efforts to the Python 3.x series. This means that while Python 2 continues to receive bug fixes, and to be updated to build correctly on new hardware and versions of supported operated systems, there will be no new full feature releases for the language or standard library.

However, while there is a large common subset between Python 2.7 and Python 3, and many of the changes involved in migrating to that common subset, or directly to Python 3, can be safely automated, some other changes (notably those associated with Unicode handling) may require careful consideration, and preferably robust automated regression test suites, to migrate effectively.

This means that Python 2.7 will remain in place for a long time, providing a stable and supported base platform for production systems that have not yet been ported to Python 3. The full expected lifecycle of the Python 2.7 series is detailed in PEP 373.


> discussion:
why we are using python for cyber security
why learn web programming?
ways to learn programming 
what is a scripting language
what is object-oriented programming
what are variables - containers in memory for your program to use
how do you name variables
what are data types
what does it mean that python is not heavily typed
what are some types of variables in python 
what are strings
what is null/none
what is int/decimal
printing from python
comments in python - comments are for people
* write your first program
 - hello world
* add comments to your program 
getting input from the user
 - add your name to your program
when to use single quotes, double quotes and triple quotes
printing special characters - \n \t
* make a program using strings, tabe and newlines to print the lesson and topic table
len() getting the length of a string or list
indexing or slicing example
how does indexing work in python
creating a substring
making strings upper case and lower case
* make a program that prints hello, world from the following variables. You may only use these variables and the print command or indexing. You can't add any strings.
hello = "hello"
mandella_quote = "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."
formatting strings - pretty printing
doing math in string formatting
* exercise - print the phone number example from slide
finding stuff 
replacing stuff
stripping white space
* print the address and the length with and without the leading and trailing white space
counting() the number of times a substring exists
 *write a program to print the number of times the word three occurs in the following quote from Monty Python
"""And the Lord spake, saying, "First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.""

math is hard - so use python
floor division
modulo
other basic math: abs, exponents, sqrt, 
importing libraries - import math


boolean expressions
= vs ==
> < >= <= operators
conditionals - if only there was a way of controlling program flow
random numbers
